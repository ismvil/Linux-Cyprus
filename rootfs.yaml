  # Note: installing kali-desktop-core before kali-tools-top10 is needed

  # pulled in via faraday -> python3-selenium -> chromium-driver, and then
  # firefox-esr is not installed as chromium satisfies www-browser.

  # Oh well. Doing so leads to a failure installing kali-desktop-xfce,
  # and in particular libgarcon-common. Apparently a broken diversion.
  # The error is:
  #
  # ~~~~
  # Configuration file '/etc/xdg/menus/xfce-applications.menu.original'
  #  ==> Deleted (by you or by a script) since installation.
  #  ==> Package distributor has shipped an updated version.
  #    What would you like to do about it ?  Your options are:
  #     Y or I  : install the package maintainer's version
  #     N or O  : keep your currently-installed version
  #       D     : show the differences between the versions
  #       Z     : start a shell to examine the situation
  #  The default action is to keep your current version.
  # ~~~~

  # So let's make sure to install kali-desktop-xfce at the same time
  # as kali-desktop-core.
